# Note that headers are optional, and do not affect add_library, but they will not
# show up in IDEs unless they are listed in add_library.

# file(GLOB HEADER_LIST CONFIGURE_DEPENDS "${MorseTranslator_SOURCE_DIR}/include/morse/*.hpp")
set(HEADER_LIST "${MorseTranslator_SOURCE_DIR}/include/morse/morse.hpp")

# Make an automatic library - will be static or dynamic based on user setting
add_library(morse morse.cpp ${HEADER_LIST})

# We need this directory, and users of our library will need it too
target_include_directories(morse PUBLIC ../include)

# This depends on (header only) boost
target_link_libraries(morse PRIVATE Boost::boost)

# All users of this library will need at least C++11
target_compile_features(morse PUBLIC cxx_std_11)
